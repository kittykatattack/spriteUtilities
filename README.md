Sprite Utilities for Pixi
=====================

This repository contains a bunch of useful functions for creating
[Pixi](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) sprites and making them easier to work with.

Sprite Utilities targets Pixi v5. (If you are looking for a version that works with Pixi 3 and 4, see the 1.0.0 release, here: https://github.com/kittykatattack/spriteUtilities/releases/tag/1.0.0);

Setting up and initializing `SpriteUtilities`
-------------------------------------------

Link the `spriteUtilities.js` file in your HTML document with a `<script>`
tag.
```js
<script src="spriteUtilities.js"><script>
```
Or, import it as a module:
```
import {SpriteUtilities} from './spriteUtilities';
```

Create a new instance of `SpriteUtilities` like this:
```js
let u = new SpriteUtilities(PIXI);
```
Supply a reference to `PIXI` as the optional argument in the
constructor. (If you don't supply it, `SpriteUtilites` will look for a
global `PIXI` object and alert you with an error if it can't find it.)

You can now access the `SpriteUtilites` instance and all its
methods using the variable reference `u`.

<a id="sprite"></a>
The `sprite` function
-------------------

Use the universal `sprite` function to make any kind of Pixi sprite.
```js
let anySprite = u.sprite(frameTextures, xPosition, yPosition);
```
The first argument, `frameTextures` can be any of the following: 

-	A single PNG image string.
-	A Pixi `Texture` object.
-	An array of texture atlas frame ids.
-	An array of single PNG image strings.
-	An array of Pixi `Texture` objects.

You can essentially throw anything at it, and it will give you back a sprite that works as it should, 
depending on the kind of texture information you've supplied. That
means you can use the `sprite` function 
as your one-stop-shop for creating any kind of sprite. Forget about
using Pixi's `Sprite` and `MovieClip` 
classes to make sprites and just use the `sprite` function for everything!

If you supply the `sprite` function with an array, it will return a
`MovieClip` sprite but with a bonus 
**state player**  built into it. The state player is just a collection of 4 properties and methods 
that make it easy to control sprite animation states. Here they are:

1. `fps`: A property to set the precise animation speed, as
frames-per-second. Its default value is 12. The `fps` is not linked to
the renderer's fps, and that means you can have sprite animations
playing at speeds that are independent of the game or application
speed. `anySprite.fps = 6`.

2. `playAnimation`: A method to play the sprite's
animation.`anySprite.playAnimation()`. You can supply it with start and end frame values if you want to play a sub-set of frames. Here's how: `anySprite.playAnimation([startFrame, endFrame])` The animation will play in a loop, by default, unless you set the sprite's `loop` property value to `false`.

3. `stopAnimation`: A method that stops the sprite's animation at the
current frame. `anySprite.stopAnimation()`.

4. `show`: A method that displays a specific frame number.
`anySprite.show(frameNumber)`.

5. `animating`: A Boolean property that will be `true` if the
animation is playing and `false` if it isn't.

<a id="sprite"></a>
`tilingSprite`
-------------

Create a sprite with an image that you can tile across its surface. The first argument is
the source for the tile image. You can use ordinary images,
texture atlas frames, or an array of image sources if you want to
tiling sprite with multiple frames. The second and third arguments
are the sprite's width and height, which determine the entire area that
the tile pattern should fill. You can optionally supply the x and y
position as the fourth and fifth arguments.
```js
let anySprite = u.tilingSprite("images/tile.png", 128, 128);
```  

<a id="filmstrip"></a>
`filmstrip`
----------

Use the`filmstrip` function to automatically turn a tileset PNG image
into an array of textures that you can use to make a sprite.
```js
u.filmstrip("anyTilesetImage.png", frameWidth, frameHeight, optionalPadding);
```
Supply `filmstrip` with the tileset image name and the width and
height of each frame. If there's padding around each frame, supply the
padding amount, in pixels. `filmstrip` returns an array of frames that
you can use to make an animated `MovieClip` sprite. 
Here's how you could use `filmstrip` with the universal `sprite`
function to quickly make a sprite with multiple frames: 
```js
let textures = u.filmstrip("tileset.png", 32, 32);
let anySprite = u.sprite(textures);
```
The `filmstrip` function automatically loads every frame from a tileset image into the sprite.

<a id="frames"></a>
`frames`
-------

But what if you only want to use a sub-set of frames from the tileset,
not all of them? Use another utility function called `frames`. The
`frames` function takes 4 arguments: the texture, a 2D array of x/y
frame position coordinates, and the width and height of each frame.
Here's how you could use the frames function to create a sprite.
```js
let textures = u.frames(
  "tileset.png",             //The tileset image
  [[0,0],[32,0],[64,0]],     //A 2D array of x/y frame coordianates
  32, 32                     //The width and height of each frame
);
let anySprite = u.sprite(textures);
```
Use the `frames` function whenever you need to create a sprite using
selected frames from a larger tileset PNG image.

<a id="frame"></a>
`frame`
-------

Use the `frame` function if you just want to create a texture using a smaller
rectangular section of a larger image. The `frame` function takes
four arguments: the image, the sub-image x position, the sub-image y
position, and the sub-image's width and height.
```
u.frame("image.png", x, y, width, height)
```
Here's how you could make a sprite using a sub-image of a larger
image. 
```js
let texture = u.frame("tileset.png", 64, 128, 32, 32);
let anySprite = u.sprite(texture);
```
Use the `frame` function to
[blit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_blit) a smaller image from bigger image.

<a id="frameSeries"></a>
`frameSeries`
------------

If you've loaded a texture atlas and want a sequence of numbered frame
ids to create an animated sprite, use the `frameSeries` function.
Imagine that you have frames in a texture atlas with the following id
names:
```js
frame0.png
frame1.png
frame2.png
```
To create a sprite in Pixi using these frames, you would ordinarily
write some code using Pixi's `MovieClip` class
(`PIXI.extras.MovieClip`) that looks something like this:
```js
let frameTextures = ["frame0.png", "frame1.png", "frame2.png"];
let anySprite = MovieClip.fromFrames(frameTextures);
```
You now have a sprite with 3 frames that you can control. That's not too painful, but what if you
had 100 animation frames? You definitely don't want to manually type in
100 frame id's into an array. Instead, use the `frameSeries` function.

`frameSeries` takes four arguments: the start frame sequence number,
the end frame sequence number, the optional base file name, and the optional file extension.
You could use the `frameSeries` function to create the sprite from the
texture atlas frame ids like this:
```
let frameTextures = u.frameSeries(0, 2, "frame", ".png");
let anySprite = u.sprite(frameTextures);
```
If you had 100 animation frames, your code might look like this:
```
let frameTextures = u.frameSeries(0, 99, "frame", ".png");
let anySprite = u.sprite(frameTextures);
```
That's much better!

<a id="text"></a>
`text`
------

Use the `text` method to quickly create a text sprite.
```js
let messgae = u.text("Hello!", "32px Futura", "black", xPosition, yPosition); 
```
Only the first argument, the text you want to display, is required.
The second argument is the font size and family. You can use any
system font, or a font from a loaded font file. The thrid argument is the
fill color. Text colors can provided as RGBA, HLSA, hexadecimal,
or HTML color string values, such as “blue” or “green.” The last
arguments are the text's x and y position.

You can add any additional Pixi text properties by setting the text sprite's
`style` property.
```js
message.style = {fill: "black", font: "16px Helvetica"}; 
```
Check out the [full list of Pixi Text properties](http://pixijs.github.io/docs/PIXI.Text.html) to find out
which styles you can apply.

To change the text display at any time, use the text's `content` property.
```js
message.content = "Updated text!";
```

<a id="bitmaptext"></a>
`bitmapText`
-----------

Bitmap text is text that is rendered using images for the letter
shapes. (Ordinary font files just contain instructions about how 
your computer should draw the font shapes.) Bitmap fonts need to load the
image and data files containing the letter shapes, but they tend to
display more reliably across different platforms.

The `bitmapText` method lets you quickly create a bitmap text sprite,
like this:
```js
let message = u.bitmapText("Hello!", "42px disko", align, tint, xPosition, yPosition); 
```
Only the first argument, the text to display, is required. The second
argument is the font size and family. 

The third argument is the alignment, which determines how the text
should be displayed if it appears on more than one line. Alignment
values can be any of these three strings: "left", "right" or "center".

The fourth argument, tint, is the color that the font should be
tinted. This can be any RGBA, HLASA, Hex, or HTML string color value.

Finally, the last two values are the text's x and y position values.

<a id="rectangle"></a>
`rectangle`
----------

The `rectangle` method lets you quickly draw a rectangle.
```js
u.rectangle(
  width, height, fillStyle, strokeStyle, lineWidth, xPosition, yPosition
);
```
`width` and `height` are the size, in pixels, of the rectangle.
They're the only two arguments that are required.
`fillStyle` is color for the inside fill color of the
rectangle, and `strokeStyle` is the color code for the outline. (You
can use hex colors, RGBA colors, or even any [HTML color names](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp), like "blue" or "pink".)
`lineWidth` determines how thick, in pixels, the rectangle's outline
should be. (The default value is 0, which means the rectangle will have
no outline.) The last two values are the rectangle's x and y
position.

Here's how to use the `rectangle` method to create a green square
with a 2 pixel wide pink outline:
```js
let square = u.rectangle(64, 64, "seaGreen", "hotPink", 2);
```
(Because the last two arguments, x and y, haven't been provided, the
rectangle will have default x and y values of 0.)

Rectangles also have `strokeStyle`, `lineStyle` and `lineWidth` properties
that you can change at any time.

<a id="circle"></a>
`circle`
-------

Use the `circle` method to draw a circle.
```js
u.circle(diameter, fillStyle, strokeStyle, lineWidth, xPosition, yPosition)
```
The arguments are similar to the `rectangle` method's arguments,
except that the fist one is the diameter, in pixels, of the circle you
want to draw. Here's how to draw a blue circle with a diameter of 64
pixels and a purple outline 3 pixels wide.
```js
let ball = u.circle(64, "powderBlue", "plum", 3);
```
A circle's x and y position is anchored to the top left corner of an
invisible rectangular bounding box that is surrounding the circle. To
set the x and y position to the center of the circle, use the
`anchor.set` method:
```js
ball.anchor.set(0.5, 0.5);
```
This sets the `x` and `y` positions to `0.5`, which means "the
positions that are at half the circle's width and height". In other
words, its center.

Circles have `fillStyle`, `strokeStyle`, `diameter` and `radius` properties that
you can access and change later if you need to.

<a id="line"></a>
`line`
-----
The `line` method lets you quickly draw a straight line.
```js
u.line(color, width, ax, ay, bx, by)
```
The `color` should be a hexadecimal color value. (Just as with
rectangles or cirlces, you
can use hex colors, RGBA colors, or HTML  color name strings.) The last four arguments define the line's start and end points. `ax`
and `ay` are it's start point; `bx` and `by` are it's end points.
Here's how to create red line, 3 pixels wide, with a start x/y point
of 64 and and an end x/y point of 128.

```js
let diagonal = u.line(0xff0000, 3, 64, 64, 128, 128);
```
(Yes, as you can see above, you can use a hex color code with
rectangles, circles or lines if you want to!)

You can change the start and end points at any time. Here's how you
set the line's end point to an x position of 100 and a y position of
90.
```js
diagonal.bx = 100;
diagonal.by = 90;
```
The line will be re-drawn to these coordinates as soon as you set
them.

Lines have `ax`, `ay`, `bx`, `by`, `strokeStyle` and `width`
properties that you can acess and change.

<a id="grid"></a>
`grid`
-----

`grid` is a very useful method that plots a grid of sprites for you. It
returns a Pixi container object and fills it with a grid of sprites -
any kind of sprite you need. Here's an example of how to use it to
plot a 5 by 4 grid of black circles.

```js
let circles = u.grid(
  5,    //The number of columns
  4,    //The number of rows
  48,   //The width of each cell
  48,   //The height of each cell
  true, //Should the sprite be centered in the cell?
  0,    //The sprite's xOffset from the left of the cell 
  0,    //The sprite's yOffset from the top of the cell

  //A function that describes how to make each peg in the grid. 
  //A random diameter and color are selected for each one
  () => {
    let ball = u.circle(24, 0x000000);
    return ball;
  },

  //Run any optional extra code after each ball is made
  () => console.log("extra!")
);

```
The `grid` method returns a Pixi `Container` object called `circles`. All the sprites
inside each cell of the grid are children of that `circles` Container.
Because it’s a Container, you can manipulate the entire grid just like any
other sprite. That means you can set its `x` and `y` position
values to move the grid around the canvas. (The default x/y position
is 0.)

You can access the individual sprites in the grid through the
Container's `children` array property.
```js
circles.children
```
Just loop through the `children` array to set or access any properties
of sprites in the grid.

<a id="group"></a>
`group`
------

A quick way to make a Pixi `Container` and add sprites to it. Just supply
the `group` method with a single spirte, or a list of sprites, and it
will return a container with those sprites as its children.
```
let container = u.group(spriteOne, spriteTwo, spriteThree);
```
You can alternatively create an empty group, and add sprites to it as you
need to using `addChild`, like this:
```
let container = u.group();
container.addChild(anySprite);
```

<a id="batch"></a>
`batch`
-------

A quick way to create a Pixi `ParticleContainer`.
```
let particleContainer = u.batch();
particleContainer.addChild(anySprite);
```
You can optionally create the batch with two arguments: the maximum
number of sprites the container can inclue and the `ParticleContainer`
object's `options`. Here's how to create a particle container with a
maximum number of 20,000 sprites, and all the options set to `true`
```js
let particleContainer = u.batch(20000, {rotation: true, alpha: true, scale: true, uvs: true});
```
The default size is 15,000. So, if you have to contain more sprites,
set it to a higher number. The `options` argument is an object with
five Boolean properties that you can set: `scale`, `position`,
`rotation`, `alpha`, and `uvs`. The default value for position is `true`, but all
the others are set to `false`. 

<a id="shoot"></a>
`shoot` 
-------

The `shoot` methods let you create bullet sprites at any position on
another sprite.

The first step to making bullets is to create an array to store the
new bullet sprites that you’re going to make:
```js
let bullets = [];
```
You also need a sprite that's going to do the shooting.
```js
let tank = u.sprite("tank.png");
```
If you want your tank sprite to rotate around its center, then 
you'll want to center its x/y anchor point, like this:
```js
tank.anchor.set(0.5, 0,5);
```
Next, use the `shoot` method to create bullet sprites.
```js
u.shoot(
  tank,           //The sprite that will be shooting
  tank.rotation,  //The angle at which to shoot
  32,             //The x point on the tank where the bullet should start
  0,              //The y point on the tank where the bullet should start
  stage,          //The container you want to add the bullet to
  7,              //The bullet's speed (pixels per frame)
  bullets,        //The array used to store the bullets

  //A function that returns the sprite that should
  //be used to make each bullet
  () => g.circle(8, "red")
);

```
The 3rd and 4th arguments are the local x and y points on the tank
where you want the bullets to start from. The 5th argument is the Pixi
container that you want to add the bullets to. The 7th argument is the
array that you want to add each bullet to.

The most important argument is the last one:
```js
() => u.circle(8, "red")
```
That’s a function that creates and returns the kind of sprite you want 
to use as a bullet. In this case, it’s a red circle 8 pixels in diameter. 
You can use any of the sprite-creation methods from this Sprite Utilities library,
any standard Pixi sprite creation methods, or use your own custom function that
creates and returns a sprite.

All the bullet sprites that the `shoot` method creates are added to
the `bullets` array, so just loop though the sprites in that array to
check for collisions with other sprites.

<a id="shake"></a>
`shake` 
-------

Use the `shake` method to make a sprite shake or create a screen-shake
effect. Here's how to use it:
```js
u.shake(spriteToShake, magnitude, angular?);
```
The `shake` method’s first argument is the sprite, and the second is the shake 
magnitude in radians. The third argument is a Boolean that when `true` means 
the shaking should be angular around the sprite’s center point. 

Here's how you could make a sprite called `screen` shake around its center with a
magnitude of 0.05.
```js
u.shake(gameScene, 0.05, true);
```
You can alternatively make the shaking happen up and down on the x/y plane.
Just set the second argument to a number, in pixels, that determines the 
maximum amount by which the sprite should shake. Then set the third 
argument to `false`, to disable angular shaking. 
```js
shake(gameScene, 16, false);
```
Which shaking style you prefer is entirely up to you.

`shake` is an animation effect, and you won't see it unless run the
SpriteUtilities `update` method inside a game loop. Here's how:
```js
function gameLoop() {
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

  //Update the SpriteUtilities library each frame
  u.update();
}
```
The `update` method takes care animating the shake effect for you.

<a id="remove"></a>
`remove` 
-------
`remove` is a global convenience method that will remove any sprite, or an
argument list of sprites, from its parent.
```
u.remove(spriteOne, spriteTwo, spriteThree);
```
This is really useful because you never need to know what the sprite's
parent is.

You can also remove a whole array of sprites from their parents, like
this:
```js
u.remove(arrayOfSprites);
```
Easy!

<a id="color"></a>
`color`: Convert HTML and RGBA colors to Hexadecimal
------------------------------------------------------------

Do you like Pixi, but don't like Hexadecimal color codes? Use
`color` to convert any ordinary HTML color string name (like
"blue" or "green",) or any RGBA value to its equivalent Hex code.
```js
let hexColor = u.color("darkSeaGreen");
```
Now just use `hexColor` wherever Pixi asks for a color code. Yes, all
of the [HTML color string names](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp) are supported.
